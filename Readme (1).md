# NFT Lending Smart Contract 

## Project Description

## Project Vision
The project aims to create a decentralized ecosystem for sharing and utilizing NFTs effectively. By enabling time-bound lending, this platform promotes the responsible use of digital assets and encourages collaboration among NFT owners and borrowers.

## Key Features
1. **Secure NFT Lending**: NFT owners can lend their tokens to borrowers with time-limited agreements.
2. **Ownership Verification**: Only the rightful owner of an NFT can initiate a lending process.
3. **Borrower Accountability**: Borrowers are required to return NFTs once the lending period ends.
4. **Admin Retrieval**: Admins can retrieve overdue NFTs if borrowers fail to return them on time.
5. **Transparent Records**: Lending details, including borrower identity, start and end times, and status, are stored on-chain for transparency.
